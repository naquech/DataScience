    "\n",
    "So far, we have looked at building simple  and deep AEs for data compression and de-noising. We also looked at how CNN based AE architectures can produce improved results for compression and de-noising tasks in image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will look at how to implement a basic character-level sequence-to-sequence model using RNNs, following a similar encoder-decoder approach. The model will be able to translate short English phrases into short French, in a character-by-character fashion. Such a model can be further modified to process whole words instead of characters. You are encouraged to consider this experiment as a baseline model which you can further scale and modify according to an analytical question or a specific business need. \n",

    "## Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) Models \n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model is a deep learning model that converts an input sequence into an output sequence. In this context, the sequence could be a list of symbols, corresponding to the words in a sentence. The seq2seq model has achieved great success in fields such as machine translation, chat bots and text summarization. All of these tasks can be regarded as the task to learn a model that converts an input sequence into an output sequence.\n",

    "### Encoder Model and the \"Thought Vector\"\n",
    "Above we see that the encoder model is supplied with input \"HEY\".  For a character level model, we first split the complete sentence down to its character level. So first \"H\" is fed into the network and an intermediate state vector (known as a **Thought Vector** , shown in yellow) is formed containing the learned information of \"H\". **The thought vector is used for remembering key features of our input data as a standard function of an encoder**. Followed by this, the thought vector is fed into the second RNN input and it combines the information seen thus far (i.e. \"H\") with the new data (\"E\"). Finally, \"Y\" is added to the thought vector. The procedure so far is done by a so-called encoder. It takes characters (or other items) as input and it forms a thought vector as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **“Thought vector”** is a term popularized by Geoffrey Hinton, the prominent deep-learning researcher now at Google. It is a very interesting topic and you can optionally [follow this link](https://skymind.ai/wiki/thought-vectors) to read an article for a detailed understanding with wider applications of thought vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder Model \n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple seq2seq approach, the decoder model inputs the thought vector and produces an output. Based on the business need, We can train our seq2seq model for a number of possible applications. We can buils a chatbot using such an architecture model but by using words instead of characters. We can also train such a network for language translation. Other variants of such modeling can also offer features like image captioning, generating new images from text etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key strength  for this architecture is that the decoder is able to convert some numbers back to a text. This allows to generate some text in response to some given text. If the thought vector is small enough, then all input data is compressed into a small vector which contains just enough information. As an AE, The model also acts as a compressor as it learns how to store information as efficient as possible into the thought vector and how to decode the compression into text. "
